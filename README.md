<p align="center">
Calipso-injector (Cali for short) is a basic injector for DLLs. DLL injection is a technique that allows you to modify the behaviour of a process by running your code inside it.
</p>

<p align="center">
Cali is mainly focused on injecting into GTA5, but it can also be used for other processes, although it has not been tested. Cali offers a diverse range of functionalities in a simple program. It allows you to inject DLLs into any process running on your system, with options such as manual or automatic injection. Cali is designed to be easy to use, fast, and reliable.
</p>

## Features

- **Manual injection**: You can select the target process and the DLL file to inject manually. This works by selecting the process yourself from the list by its name or ID.
- **Automatic injection**: Cali will automatically inject the DLL when the process is detected. This works by selecting the GTA5 platform from the Settings and waiting until the DLL is injected.
- **Injection delay**: Adds a delay before the DLL is injected into the process. (Most useful when auto-injecting into GTA5)
- **Close injector**: Closes the injector after a successful injection.

## Installation

To install Cali, you can either download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Harmless05/calipso-injector/releases/tag/Release) or clone the repository.

## Usage

To use Cali, you need to run it (If it doesn't open run it as an administrator). Then, head over to Settings and change the settings for your needs (default injection is process selection).

## Roadmap

Cali is still under development, and many features are planned to be added in the future. Some of them are:

- [ ] Portability (No installation needed)
- [ ] Automatic updates
  - [ ] Check for updates in the background
  - [ ] Manual update checking
- [ ] Run just the platform (Steam, Epic Games, Rockstar Launcher)
- [ ] Tutorial for new users
- [ ] Kill injected process
- [ ] Cancel injection
